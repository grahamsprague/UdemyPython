Go Home"],"paragraphs":["Recently declassified and heavily redacted documents have been uncovered that suggest aliens were interested in visiting earth until they got close enough to pick up several episodes of the Kardashians on television.","The aliens, who remain anonymous, have stated that they have postponed their visit indefinitely after seeing the show.","While some conspiracy theorists have speculated that the Kardashians are working with the government to protect the planet from aliens, there is no concrete evidence to back up these claims.","What is known, however, is that the show has been a huge hit with the extraterrestrial community, leading to the cancellation of many scheduled visits.","The show has been so popular among aliens that it has sparked a new type of tourism, with many aliens traveling to Earth specifically to watch the Kardashians.","While the Kardashians have not commented on the situation, some have speculated that this newfound popularity may lead to new business opportunities for the family.","Whatever the case may be, one thing is certain: the Kardashians have managed to scare away aliens.","It seems that the aliens have made the wise decision to stay away from Earth until the show is no longer on air.","It's hard to say how long that will be, but for now, it looks like Earth is safe from extraterrestrial visitors."]},"comments":[
