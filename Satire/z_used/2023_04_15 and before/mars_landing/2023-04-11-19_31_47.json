            "NASA and SpaceX are rumored to be looking for a movie director to fake the upcoming 'missions' to mars. Since the whole moon landing fakes worked out so well.",
            "The two space agencies are said to be in talks with several Hollywood directors, but are having a hard time finding someone who is willing to take on the project.",
            "The project is said to be 'highly classified' and the director would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.",
            "The director would also have to be willing to work with a very tight budget and schedule, as the 'missions' are set to launch in the next few years.",
            "If you are a director who is interested in the project, you can contact NASA or SpaceX directly."
